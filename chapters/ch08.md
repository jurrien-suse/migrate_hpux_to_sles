#### Chapter 8: LVM and Filesystems (HP LVM/VxFS vs. Linux LVM/Btrfs/Snapper)

* **8.1 Introduction: From Volume Group to Mount Point**
    * Review of core disk concepts: physical volumes, volume groups, logical volumes, and filesystems.
    * The fundamental difference between proprietary and open-source volume managers.
* **8.2 HP-UX Disk Management**
    * The role and commands of **HP's LVM** (`pvcreate`, `vgcreate`, `lvcreate`).
    * Working with the **Veritas File System (VxFS)** and its journaling features.
    * Traditional partitioning (`disksetup`).
* **8.3 SLES 16 Disk Layout and Modern Linux Standards**
    * **Mandatory Boot Partitions (UEFI):** The requirement for a separate `/boot/efi` partition (often $\approx$ 550 MB).
    * **Recommended OS Layout:** The best practice of having the **OS root (`/`) not on LVM**, but on a dedicated partition using **Btrfs** (recommended size: $\approx$ 64 GiB).
    * **Data Strategy:** Using **Linux LVM** for larger data volumes (`/home`, `/var/lib`, custom application data), similar to the traditional HP-UX approach.
* **8.4 The Power of Btrfs and Snapper**
    * Understanding **Btrfs** (B-tree File System): Copy-on-Write (CoW) and checksumming.
    * The **Snapper** tool: How it leverages Btrfs snapshots for **instant system rollback** (post-patching safety).
    * Snapshot administration: Creating, listing, and rolling back snapshots.
* **8.5 Linux LVM Administration**
    * Core commands: `pvcreate`, `vgcreate`, `lvcreate` (noting the syntactical similarity but internal difference).
    * Resizing and extending Linux Logical Volumes.
* **8.6 Transitioning Data: VxFS to Ext4/XFS/Btrfs**
    * Considerations when migrating data from VxFS to standard Linux filesystems.
* **8.7 Summary: Stability Through Snapshots**
